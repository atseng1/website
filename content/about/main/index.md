  I am currently a PhD Student in the Department of Epidemiology at University of Washington. I graduated with a Master of Public Health (MPH) in Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics from Columbia University and with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Health Geography and Economics from McGill University. I have substantial experience in infectious disease epidemiology including research on zoonotic diseases, HIV, and tuberculosis, and public health deployments at the Washington State Department of Health and the Chelan-Douglas Health District in Central Washington during the COVID-19 pandemic. My research objectives include leveraging my rigorous epidemiological, biostatistics, and environmental health training to reduce the burden of infectious diseases across diverse populations and to make communities more resilient to epidemics, in both national and global settings. Post-graduation plans include a post-doctorate program that focuses on applying advanced analytic methods to the intersection of infectious disease and environmental health in rural health settings, with long-term career plans of becoming an independent investigator. Between 2020-2022, I was a predoctoral trainee on the Biostatistics, Epidemiologic, And Bioinformatic Training in Environmental Health Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NIH T32ES015459). I was awarded a Diversity Supplement from the National Institute of Mental Health to fund my PhD Dissertation work.
