Utilizing a One Health approach, I have used various epidemiological, biostatistics, and bioinformatics applications to study infectious diseases. For my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology Thesis, I assessed livestock trade and potential zoonotic disease risk in Western Asia through a network analysis and biostatistics in collaboration with EcoHealth Alliance. As a NIH-NIEHS predoctoral fellow (NIH T32ES015459) from 2020-2022, I worked with Drs. Peter Rabinowitz, Marilyn Roberts, and Scott Weissman at the University of Washington on characterizing the diversity of sequence types through phylogenetics and the co-occurrence of heavy metal resistance genes and antibiotic resistance genes through bioinformatics in **Escherichia coli** isolates from animal and environmental sources in the Salish Sea region.
